# Chapter 1: Introduction

## Computing trends 
The history of computing has been marked by five important, and cotinuing trends: 
1. Ubiquity
    - The continual reduction in cost of computing capability has made it possible to introduce processing power in devices where it would have been uneconomic. 
    - Internet of Things, Smart Cities. 
2. Interconnection
    - The earliest computers were isolated entities. Today, computer systems are usually interconnected. 
    - They are networked into large distributed systems.   
3. Intelligence
    - The complexity of tasks that we are capable of automating and delegaitng to computers has grown steadily. 
4. Delegation
    - We routinely delegate to computers systems such safety-critical tasks as piloting aircraft. 
    - Delegation implies that we give control to computer systems. 
5. Human orientation
    - There's a steady move away from machine-oriented views of humanâ€”computer interaction towards concepts and metaphors that more closely reflect the way in which we ourselves understand the world.

Together, these trends have led to the emergence of a new field in computer science: `multiagent systems`. 

## Multiagent Systems
- An agent is a computer system that is 
capable of independent action on behalf of its user or owner.
- A multiagent system is one that consists of a number of agents, which interact with one another, typically by exchanging messages through some computer network infrastructure.
- In order to successfully interact, these agents will thus require the ability to 
cooperate, coordinate, and negotiate with each other.
